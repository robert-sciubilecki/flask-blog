This is my blog/portfolio website, a simple full-stack project with a basic UI. There are still tasks 
to be completed in its development.

Deployment: It's essential to have the website deployed, even if it's not perfect.

Debugging: It's expected that issues may arise, and debugging will be necessary.

Error handling: At this point it's a joke. If an error comes up no one will know ðŸ˜…

Cleaning: There is some unnecessary code in the project, but I prefer not to remove it hastily. I'll let it be for now.

Separation of Concerns: Currently, all the code is in one file, but this needs to change. 
There are challenges with circular imports, and while I'm not ready for this change yet, 
it's something I plan to address in the future. Perhaps starting with separate files would have been a better approach.

Documentation: Although proper documentation is often overlooked by junior developers, it's on my to-do list. 
While I have a good understanding of how the website works now, I acknowledge that it will evolve over time.
